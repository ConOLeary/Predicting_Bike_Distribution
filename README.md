# Predicting_bike_distribution

20 / 07 / 2021

* Assuming for now I should train on data for all bike stations but test on select ones
* Removing INPUT_ROWS_LIMIT can crash jupyter notebook
* Some days in the 1st Jan to 24th Feb 2020 range the dataset is supposed to cover are simply absent. The order of rows is unclear, often with various patches of records covering a few hours of a stations status.
